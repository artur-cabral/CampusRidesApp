<h2>What is the Campus Rides App?</h2>
<p>*  Campus Rides is an application that has the goal to connect Riders and Drivers on and off campus
   * Drivers offer rides and share details
      *Departure and Destination, Date & Time, Preferences, and Price
   *  Riders look for rides and choose the best fit
   *  Based on destination, price, and preferences of the ride  
   *  Campus is more connected, Drivers save gas money, and Riders save on expensive tickets

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>**“The inspiration for Campus Rides App came from a conversation with some friends and staff members about how complicated is for international students or students in general who do not own a car to get from school to the airport and nearby cities during school breaks. Since mobile development is part of my major, as of my research class, I decided to do an independent study on mobile applications development, and create an app to solve this problem.”**
