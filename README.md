<h2>What is the Campus Rides App?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Campus Rides is an application that has the goal to connect Riders and Drivers on and off campus</li>
<li>Drivers offer rides and share details</li>
<li>Departure and Destination, Date & Time, Preferences, and Price</li>
<li>Riders look for rides and choose the best fit</li>
<li>Based on destination, price, and preferences of the ride</li>  
<li>Campus is more connected, Drivers save gas money, and Riders save on expensive tickets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p><i>“The inspiration for Campus Rides App came from a conversation with some friends and staff members about how complicated is for international students or students in general who do not own a car to get from school to the airport and nearby cities during school breaks. Since mobile development is part of my major, as of my research class, I decided to do an independent study on mobile applications development, and create an app to solve this problem.”</i><br><br>
